            <p>When you crack your exercise toolkit open each week on back day, you've got a seemingly endless array of movements available. If you're overwhelmed by the sheer number of row variations, or you draw a total blank when thinking of new exercises to try, consider this list your new back blueprint.

                We took the science into account--and more. Head-to-head exercise comparison research is a bit limited, and often misleading. So rather than going strictly off of electromyography (EMG) to pick the best muscle-building exercises, we selected the following ones on a number of factors including:  
                
                Ease of learning and performing
                Total muscle stimulation and intensity
                Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)
                Availability of equipment in commercial gyms
                Here are the best back exercises for muscle growth, plus three complete back workouts incorporating the movements that you can plug into your split right away.</p>
