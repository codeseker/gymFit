            <p>To work your biceps, you'll mostly need to do exercises that isolate the muscle and force it to flex and
                supinate under load. That might not be as efficient as your training plan for some other muscles, which
                you can target as just one part of a more comprehensive plan using multi-joint movementsâ€”but isolation
                exercises allow you to really dial in on your progress and development. And building a strong set of
                biceps can only help you to get stronger overall, as all pulling movements (essential for training the
                big muscles in your back) will reap the rewards of your focused work.

                To help you hone those arms, we created this list of go-to moves to work your biceps. Some of these are
                classics; some are new. Some are a grind; some are fun. Some hit the long head of the muscle; some focus
                on the short head. To vary up the stimulus to your muscles, we'll mix up the tempo, add pauses with
                isometrics, and even change up the arm angle.</p>
