                10 Best Leg Workout Exercises for Building Muscle
                Chest | Back | Shoulders | Biceps | Triceps | Legs | Abs
                With so many choices of how to train the lower body, it's no wonder that so many lifters feel overwhelmed and skip leg day entirely. (That's your excuse, right?)
                <hr>
                This list will give you clarity, but you'll still have to work! Almost across the board, multijoint or "compound" exercises top this list. Why? In addition to recruiting more muscle mass, these exercises generate greater release of the muscle-building hormones testosterone and growth hormone. Here are the other standards we used to make our selections:
                
                Ease of learning and performing  
                Total muscle stimulation and intensity  
                Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)  
                Availability of equipment in commercial gyms  
                Build around these movements, and you can create more efficient, effective leg workouts. And with three complete workouts we've included for you, you have no more excuses. Get educated and get to work!</p>
